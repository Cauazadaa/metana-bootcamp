# ERC20 Token Variants

This project contains custom implementations of the ERC20 standard using the OpenZeppelin library. There are four token variations, each with specific functionalities:

## Implemented Features

### 1. ERC20 with God-Mode
- A special address can:
  - Mint new tokens to any address
  - Change the balance of any user
  - Transfer tokens arbitrarily between addresses

### 2. ERC20 with Sanctions
- An admin can add or remove addresses from a sanctions list.
- Sanctioned addresses cannot send or receive tokens.

### 3. ERC20 with Token Sale
- Users can buy 1000 tokens by sending 1 ETH to the contract.
- The maximum supply is 1 million tokens.
- The contract owner can withdraw ETH from the contract.

### 4. ERC20 with Token Sale and Partial Refunds
- In addition to buying, users can sell tokens back to the contract.
- For every 1000 tokens transferred to the contract, the user receives 0.5 ETH.
- The transaction fails if the contract does not have enough ETH to refund.
